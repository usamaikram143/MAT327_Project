Data analysis for the dataset of 2018-2019 Student Attendance on Daily bases in schools.
I am interested to know how many kids are registered to schools and how much parents are responsible to send their kids to schools and how often kids miss their school.
This dataset from DOE of 2018-2019 Daily attendance is a very nice small simple data to chose for someone beginner, who is doing something for the first time in analysis,
thats why I have chosen this dataset. It also has enough data for me to process basic steps.
It has 277K rows and 6 columns of data, it was updated in July 9,2021 and was provided by Department of Education(DOE).
The dataset has following information in it:
- School DBN (District borough number), which I am using as qualitative (categorical) data and it has duplicated values.
- Date.
- Enrolled (Number of students enrolled in that school on that specific date).
- Absent (number of students that were registered and was absent).
- Present (number of students who attended school).
- Released (number of students that were released from school for any reason).
